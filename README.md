# 📈 Time Series Forecasting: Course Overview & Concepts

## What Makes Time Series Data Unique?

We believe that is essential to say right away that **time series data is different** from what we are already used to. It consists of observations collected over time, making it different from traditional datasets. Unlike standard machine learning problems, time series models need to account for **trends**, **seasonality**, and **temporal dependencies**.

Besides Retail that Anastasia has mentioned in her intro speech, there are many other industries that depend on time series forecasting to make data-driven decisions. These are:

* **Finance:** Predicting stock trends and market movements.
* **Energy:** Estimating electricity consumption and optimizing supply.
* **Healthcare:** Monitoring patient vitals and predicting disease outbreaks.
* **Cybersecurity:** Detecting anomalies in network traffic and fraud prevention.

Let’s now briefly go over what we are going to touch in this course!
